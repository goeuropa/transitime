/**
 * The schedule based predictions module runs in the background. Every few minutes it looks for
 * blocks that do not have an associated vehicle. For these blocks the module creates a schedule
 * based vehicle at the location of the beginning of the block and generates predictions for the
 * entire block that are based on the scheduled departure time. The purpose of this module is to
 * generate predictions well in advance even if vehicles are assigned just a few minutes before a
 * vehicle is scheduled to start a block. This feature should of course only be used if most of the
 * time the blocks are actually run. It should not be used for agencies such as SFMTA where
 * blocks/trips are often missed because would then be often providing predictions when no vehicle
 * will arrive.
 *
 * <p>Schedule based predictions are removed once a regular vehicle is assigned to the block or the
 * schedule based vehicle is timed out via TimeoutHandlerModule due to it being
 * transitclock.timeout.allowableNoAvlForSchedBasedPredictions after the scheduled departure time
 * for the assignment.
